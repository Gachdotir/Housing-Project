n this project, I aim to create a Jupyter notebook to develop a machine learning program. The purpose of this program is to take housing property data and corresponding house values as input, and through learning from these property-value relationships, it will be able to predict the value of a new house based on its properties.
To work with this code, you should download the "housing.csv" file and place it in the same directory as your Jupyter notebook. Additionally, you'll need to import the libraries that I have listed at the beginning of the code.
